>comments: This is an accomplished implementation of a variant of an established game design, that despite your misgivings over the capability of the final AI implementation works well. The documentation provides an interesting reflection on the capabilities of the blueprint system. Overall the project is well structured and clearly annotated and commented. I agree that the AI implementation is probably "pushing the limit" at to what is tractable using blueprint scripting, but the end result is a perfectly playable game, and demonstrates a good understanding of the principles involved. The documentation of the lab exercises shows engagement with the open ended tasks.
