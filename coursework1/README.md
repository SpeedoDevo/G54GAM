>comments: This is a very good, clearly written and very well presented analysis of Hearthstone that does an excellent job of relating observations of play to underlying general principles. There's an appropriate overview of the game - using Fullerton's formal elements of play as way of structuring this was not required but is a very good choice. The section on micro choices is correct and well justified, however there are occasions when language could be better - for example, all micro level choices is HS are very meaningful - would be more critically written as all micro level choices can be seen to be meaningful by the following, to be less subjective. The final line that other cards use ... to be more discernible and integrated is a weaker justification. The macro choice section is very good. Here you might also have related the macro choice to one of the categorisations of challenges. It is good that you also identified some issues, however these could also have been related back to known categorisations of failure of choice, for example. The report overall has an appropriate writing style with thorough attention to detail.
